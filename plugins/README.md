# plugins

This directory contains a set of plugins for various software.

## list

- `mzte-mpv`: a MPV plugin written in Zig to skip SponsorBlock segments marked by yt-dlp and convert downloaded YouTube live_chat.json files into subtitles, passed into mpv.
- `tampermonkey-mzte-css`: a Tampermonkey userscript, which injects some minimal CSS into every page, which removes rounded corners (fuck rounded corners!) and improves fonts.
